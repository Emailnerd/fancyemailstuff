# fancyemailstuff



product-slider-object-v2.html

The first version of my pure CSS swipe slider, for email. Instead of targeting email clients where it doesn't work, I only target email clients where it does. This makes your codebase a lot more efficient and gives you much more control over who can or cannot see it. 

For this example I only enabled the iOS mail client. You can only see this in action in the Mail app on the iPhone. In the desktop-beowser you'll see the fallback. The technique however also works on Apple Mail and the iPadOS email client. In terms of impact, that's not as interesting as a smartphone in this case, so that's why I excluded it in the example. Feel free to experiment and make it better!
